How to use:

1. Insert the names of the tracks you want to import to `tracks.txt` file and save. One line for one track. It is not necessary to adhere to any clear pattern, but it is advisable to indicate both the name of the track and the artist. The file already contains examples of track names â€” don't forget to delete them before inserting your own.
2. Open `start.sh` or run `index.js` directly from terminal by executing `node index`.
3. Follow the instructions in the console.
